// This file contains English questions with the predicted categories of wh-words and the questions as a whole.
// 1. Individual wh-words are tagged in square brackets like "who[no/insitu/fronted/indirect]"
//    - here 'indirect' means it is pragmatically likely to be used as an indirect question.
//    - embedded wh-words that are unlikely to be used as indirect questions, are tagged with 'no'.
// 2. The syntactic structure of each question as a whole is categorized at the end of each line as "polar/wh/insitu/elliptic/decl/risingdecl"
//    - here 'elliptic' is intended for non-wh-questions whose subject-verb order cannot be determined, typically because there is no matrix verb.
//    - 'wh' means a fronted-wh question; 'insitu' means an insitu-wh question; if a question has both, the former wins.

// Annotation instructions:
// If a line is mis-classified, please duplicate and correct it (both the wh-tags and the overall classification), and
// comment out the original line by prefixing "//"/. 
// To help me figure out what the current system is doing wrong, consider adding a "//"-comment at the end of a line briefly
// explaining what the problem might be (especially for languages I don't speak).
